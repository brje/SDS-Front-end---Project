You have a few different options for how to run this project, either by setting up a live server or hosting the page on GitHub Pages.

Option 1: Install the "Live Server" extension from the VSCode Marketplace. After installation, open the project in VSCode and look for 'Go Live' in the bottom bar. Click on it, and the locally hosted webpage should open in your browser.

Option 2: Host the webpage on GitHub Pages. First, fork or clone the repository into your own GitHub account. Then, open the project in VSCode. Next, edit the package.json file and modify the "homepage" field as follows: "homepage": "https://[Your GitHub username].github.io/[your repository name]". Finally, run the following command in the VSCode terminal: npm run deploy."

You are free to use code in your own programs.
